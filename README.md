## A blog app made with Angular.js (front-end) and Flask Python Microframework (back-end).
 
### To run it on your local machine:

 1. Clone this repo

 2. Install all the necessary packages (best done inside of a virtual environment)

    > pip install -r requirements.txt

    In case you get an error 'failed building wheel for pillow' or smth similar and
    you're on Debian or Ubuntu you probably need to install Pythonâ€™s development libraries for Pillow via
    > sudo apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools 
    
    and then install Pillow again with
    > pip install pillow

 3. Run the app

    > python runserver.py
    
 4. Initialize the db (the server must still be running, so open a new terminal window first)

    > python manage.py init_db 
    
    (this will create a 'posts' db with one sample post and a user 'Admin' with email 'me@test.com' and password '111111')

 5. Install necessary packages
    > npm install
    
 6. Bundle all the necessary files (this will create a 'dist' directory in the 'static' folder)
    > gulp build 
 
 7. Start watching JS files for changes to automatically re-bundle them (note that this only watches your custom Js files, if you're adding an Angular module or 
 other third-party libs you need to manually add the path to it to 'bundle-vendor.config.js' and call gulp bundle-vendor to update the vendor.js file).
    > gulp watch
 
 8. The site should be ready and running at http://localhost:5000/
